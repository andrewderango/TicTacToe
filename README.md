# TicTacToe with Tkinter

## Overview
Welcome to my TicTacToe with Tkinter project! This simple yet engaging game allows users to play TicTacToe against four different computer difficulties, including an unbeatable "Impossible" mode that uses the [Minimax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) algorithm to simulate every possible game, then select the move that renders the optimal outcomes.

## Demo
Check out the [video demonstration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bFMxZmELC0g) to see the TicTacToe game in action.

## Features
1. **User-Friendly Interface**: The game is built using Tkinter, providing a clean and intuitive user interface.
2. **Multiple Difficulty Levels**: Choose from four different difficulty levels for the computer opponent - Easy, Medium, Hard, and Impossible.
3. **Choose Who Goes First**: Decide whether you or the computer goes first, adding an extra layer of strategy to the game.
4. **Record Keeping**: The player's record is displayed at the bottom of the screen, keeping track of wins, losses, and draws.
5. **Unbeatable AI**: The "Impossible" difficulty employs the Minimax algorithm, making it nearly impossible for the player to beat.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually included with Python installations)
